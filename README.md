# Library
Library project from The Odin Project.

[Live version](https://al-moreton.github.io/library/)

## How it's made?
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First time building a project with Objects. I've also added functions to the object.prototype to be shared across all added books.

## Optimisation and improvements
Gone a bit over the top with additions and improvements:
- Filter and sort functionality using array methods
- Ability to change layout to a table layout (i've built the layouts using `innerHTML`, and I know this isn't the best way to do it)
- Added image shows in background of grid layout
- Added a star rating system (with animation on mouseover)
- Notifications confirming actions when adding, deleting, editing, etc
- Added local storage so books save after reload and close

## Things I would like to add
- Use a book API to get metadata automatically
- Add a favourites function
- Add a way to display a reading list, with a priority of what to read next, and if a user has it on their bookshelf
